IAP 1.6 includes by default project dashboards, a feature added in version Curie R3 of the product (see [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/igrc-platform/dashboards/advanced-configuration/project-based-dashboards.md %}) for more information). IAP 1.6 is as such compatible with Curie R2, however, all project dashboards will be ignored.  

When upgrading to IAP 1.6 in a version Curie R2 of the product and when the default dashboards are used in the project, please do not remove them from the project when migrating.
