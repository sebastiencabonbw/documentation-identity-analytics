# ACLs definitions  

The access rights to share and shared folders are displayed in IAS/IAP interfaces as Access Control Lists (ACLs). There are three different ways to display them:
- simplified ACLs, for a quick and easy understanding, especially for business end-users,
- basic ACLs, for a mapping to the Microsoft Windows permissions that are set in the Windows GUI,
- advanced ACLs, for expert end-users.

In most of the tables, the simplified ACLs are used. When using the Share and Folders details pages or windows, the end-user has the possibility to check basic ACLs and to display them as advanced ACLs if needed. 

Here is the definition of each ACLs display options:
