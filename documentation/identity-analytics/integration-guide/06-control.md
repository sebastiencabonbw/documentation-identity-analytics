# Available Controls

IAP comes with more than 100 off-the-shelf controls. These controls identify problems related to:

- Data quality
- Security policy violation
- Compliance gaps such as access certification
- Discrepancies through peer group and predictive analysis

These controls are part of the data model and are presented in each detail pane. They are also used to compute risk scores. You can use them in your own dashboards, reports, reviews and analytics. You can also search for errors through the search pages. (You will have to switch to "free search" and enable "show extended attributes" to do this.)

Here is an extract of the available controls in IAP. Please consult "Settings &rarr; System &rarr; Manage Controls Execution" for an updated list of the controls available in your instance.  

Note that the Booster for PAM and Booster for AD functions, now integrated into Identity Analytics, also come with additional predefined controls which are listed at the end of this page. Please go to [Booster for AD](#ad-booster-controls) or [PAM Booster Controls](#pam-booster-controls) sections for the control details.

Adding clients to this security group mitigates this scenario.
However, to protect against unsecured records or to permit members of the DnsUpdateProxy group to register records in zones that allow only secured dynamic updates, you must create a dedicated user account and configure DHCP servers to perform DNS dynamic updates by using the credentials of this account (user name, password, and domain). Multiple DHCP servers can use the credentials of one dedicated user account."

By default, the only member of the group is the Administrator account for the forest root domain. This group is automatically added to the Administrators group in every domain in the forest, and it provides complete access for configuring all domain controllers. Members in this group can modify the membership of all administrative groups. Membership can be modified only by the default service administrator groups in the root domain. This is considered a service administrator account."

- **Control ID:** `grp_Enterprise_Read_Only_Domain_Controllers`
- **Control Type:** security groups
- **Entity:** Account
- **Name:** Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers
- **Risk Level:** 0
- **Risk Description:** "Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the enterprise. Except for account passwords, a Read-only domain controller holds all the Active Directory objects and attributes that a writable domain controller holds. However, changes cannot be made to the database that is stored on the Read-only domain controller. Changes must be made on a writable domain controller and then replicated to the Read-only domain controller.
Read-only domain controllers address some of the issues that are commonly found in branch offices. These locations might not have a domain controller. Or, they might have a writable domain controller, but not the physical security, network bandwidth, or local expertise to support it."

- **Name:** IIS_IUSRS
- **Risk Level:** 0
- **Risk Description:** IIS_IUSRS is a built-in group that is used by Internet Information Services beginning with IIS 7.0. A built-in account and group are guaranteed by the operating system to always have a unique SID. IIS 7.0 replaces the IUSR_MachineName account and the IIS_WPG group with the IIS_IUSRS group to ensure that the actual names that are used by the new account and group will never be localized. For example, regardless of the language of the Windows operating system that you install, the IIS account name will always be IUSR, and the group name will be IIS_IUSRS.

- **Control ID:** `grp_Incoming_Forest_Trust_Builders`
- **Control Type:** security groups
- **Entity:** Account
- **Name:** Incoming Forest Trust Builders
- **Risk Level:** 0
- **Risk Description:** "Members of the Incoming Forest Trust Builders group can create incoming, one-way trusts to this forest. Active Directory provides security across multiple domains or forests through domain and forest trust relationships. Before authentication can occur across trusts, Windows must determine whether the domain being requested by a user, computer, or service has a trust relationship with the logon domain of the requesting account.
To make this determination, the Windows security system computes a trust path between the domain controller for the server that receives the request and a domain controller in the domain of the requesting account. A secured channel extends to other Active Directory domains through interdomain trust relationships. This secured channel is used to obtain and verify security information, including security identifiers (SIDs) for users and groups."

- **Control ID:** `grp_Protected_Users`
- **Control Type:** security groups
- **Entity:** Account
- **Name:** Protected Users
- **Risk Level:** 0
- **Risk Description:** "Members of the Protected Users group are afforded additional protection against the compromise of credentials during authentication processes.
This security group is designed as part of a strategy to effectively protect and manage credentials within the enterprise. Members of this group automatically have non-configurable protection applied to their accounts. Membership in the Protected Users group is meant to be restrictive and proactively secure by default. The only method to modify the protection for an account is to remove the account from the security group.
This domain-related, global group triggers non-configurable protection on devices and host computers running Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1, and on domain controllers in domains with a primary domain controller running Windows Server 2012 R2. This greatly reduces the memory footprint of credentials when users sign in to computers on the network from a non-compromised computer.
Depending on the account’s domain functional level, members of the Protected Users group are further protected due to behavior changes in the authentication methods that are supported in Windows.
Members of the Protected Users group cannot authenticate by using the following Security Support Providers (SSPs): NTLM, Digest Authentication, or CredSSP. Passwords are not cached on a device running Windows 8.1, so the device fails to authenticate to a domain when the account is a member of the Protected User group.
The Kerberos protocol will not use the weaker DES or RC4 encryption types in the preauthentication process. This means that the domain must be configured to support at least the AES cipher suite.
The user’s account cannot be delegated with Kerberos constrained or unconstrained delegation. This means that former connections to other systems may fail if the user is a member of the Protected Users group.
The default Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) lifetime setting of four hours is configurable by using Authentication Policies and Silos, which can be accessed through the Active Directory Administrative Center. This means that when four hours has passed, the user must authenticate again."

- **Control ID:** `grp_Read_Only_Domain_Controllers`
- **Control Type:** security groups
- **Entity:** Account
- **Name:** Read-Only Domain Controllers
- **Risk Level:** 0
- **Risk Description:** "This group is comprised of the Read-only domain controllers in the domain. A Read-only domain controller makes it possible for organizations to easily deploy a domain controller in scenarios where physical security cannot be guaranteed, such as branch office locations, or in scenarios where local storage of all domain passwords is considered a primary threat, such as in an extranet or in an application-facing role.
Because administration of a Read-only domain controller can be delegated to a domain user or security group, an Read-only domain controller is well suited for a site that should not have a user who is a member of the Domain Admins group. A Read-only domain controller encompasses the following functionality:
Read-only AD DS database
Unidirectional replication
Credential caching
Administrator role separation
Read-only Domain Name System (DNS)"
